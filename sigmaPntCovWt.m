% Function name: sigmaPntCovWt
% Returns two vectors with weights assigned to each sigma point and
% covariance around each point
% Input: 
% d = dimension of the state vector
% alpha=Factor deciding the spread of sigma points around the mean
% k= parameter that changes with the distribution of the data.k=2 for
% Gaussian distribution
% lambda = controls the spread of sigma points based on different distributions
% and dimensionality of state vectors
% Output:
% weights_pnt= weights corresponding to each sigma point,(2Xd+1,1)
% weights_cov= weights corresponding to covraiance,(2Xd+1,1)
